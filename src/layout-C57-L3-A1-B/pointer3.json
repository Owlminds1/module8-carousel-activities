    },
    
    
    {
        "Question":"Why does the presenter hesitate to accept the investor’s proposal?",
        "Answer":["Kobee believes that a higher share means less profit which ultimately impacts the money the team can make. He also thinks that if the investor wants to spend the money on marketing, that’s already been going well. ","When an investor decides to invest in a company, the profit share is the percentage that the investor takes from the sales. The higher the share (stake), the more money in the pocket of the investor. This can ultimately impact how much the company makes, what kind of salaries the company can offer to its employees, and the kind of decisions the company has to make based on the investor’s input. Higher share also means higher input from the investor so it becomes challenging to run the company the way the founder would want."]

        "Question":"What is the presenters’ final decision? Do you think he made the right decision?",
        "Answer":["He says no. He makes a counter offer for a 10% share, but the investor doesn’t agree and wants more. Finally, Kobee makes a sensible decision to protect the interests of his team to ensure sustainability."]
