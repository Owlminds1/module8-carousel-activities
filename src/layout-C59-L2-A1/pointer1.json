    "USP stands for unique selling point i.e. what is special about a product that makes it stand out.",
    "Every product, however, may not be unique. It may not even be considered a problem to a solution.",
    "An exceptional brand and its product that does the job well will always stand out regardless of how many other brands try to do the same. "
