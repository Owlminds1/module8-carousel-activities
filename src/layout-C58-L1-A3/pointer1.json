    "They have asked the instructors to pass the survey during the workshop.",
    "Each student has responded differently, but all the questions are the same.",
    "Will you be able to guess the question from the list based on the response you see? ",
    "And also tell whether the question is open-ended or close-ended?",
    "Close-ended questions invite responses in the form of a yes or a no, whereas open-ended questions invite multiple answers that contain details. Open-ended questions provide deeper learning.",
    "For example: If the response is: The workshop was very engaging, interesting, and super fun. We identify this as an open response.",
    "So then: What is the question?",
    "We identify the question to be an open-ended question i.e. How was the workshop?",
    "Similarly, If the response is: The workshop was engaging. We identify this as an open response. ",
    "So then: What is the question?",
    "We identify the question to be a close-ended question i.e. Was the workshop engaging or boring?",
    "You will get the hang of it! Ready? Let’s go!"
