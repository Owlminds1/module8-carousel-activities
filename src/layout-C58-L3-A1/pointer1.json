    "If a product doesn’t solve a problem, it might as well not be in the market. For example, buying shoes that are a good fit for walking solves a problem of fitness. But what about shoes that are simply shiny and have no actual reason for why they are made?",
    "If the customer is unaware of the problem it solves, the product when presented will make itself known for its use. Then, another example of a product is a walkman with more buttons, little storage, and a complex system to navigate music. But the customers didn’t know such a product could be further simplified until an IPod with only three buttons came along with an exceptionally simple interface with more storage and user-friendly navigation."
