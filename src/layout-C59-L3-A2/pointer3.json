        "question":"What are the two different ways of seeing purpose?",
        "answers":["Purpose can be profit i.e. prioritising making money first.","It can also be a larger good being the reason why a company exists and the direction it wants to pursue.","The equation of a profitable purpose is ineffective. When the larger good is the purpose, profits follow on their own.","What you bring first and  what you bring next is determined by this purpose."]

        "question":"What happens when you are genuinely interested in doing good as a company?",
        "answers":["When you do what’s genuinely good for society and genuinely good for the planet, you earn trust from the customers.","That then becomes one of the biggest differentiators of your company and your brand.","So even if your purpose is not profit-oriented, the outcome naturally leads to profit."]

        "question":"What example does the speaker reference to show how purpose drives products?",
        "answers":["You must define your purpose beyond just peddling products, and doing ad and marketing campaigns.","Example: transgender population who struggled to use their cards (name on the card doesn’t match the name of the individual after the transition), were occasionally denied service in the name of identity. So Mastercard came up with the solution of True Name Card where the customer can use the name as they like after the transition (regardless of the legal processes). It was a controversial topic but it took one Canadian Bank to implement it and now it’s done in 28 countries  and is one of MCs most profitable products. It's about solving a problem while being purposeful."]
