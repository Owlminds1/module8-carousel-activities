    "Market segments refers to a group of people who have similar needs and are likely to respond to a product that fulfills their needs.",
    "But market segments can be specific or broad. For example, for stationary, the market segment can be either education or school supplies. Education is very broad, which makes it challenging to specify who in education would be interested in the product. But when we say school supplies, we immediately know that any student, instructor, or staff who learns or teaches at a school would have use for stationary items."
