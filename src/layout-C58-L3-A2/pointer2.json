    "Every product has market fit. If it’s a good product that solves a problem, there are surely people who want to buy, use, and promote this product.",
    "A product with product-market fit is a 'must-have' (like a lunchbox) rather than a 'nice-to-have' (like a collectible i.e. a showpiece), as it solves a real, common problem. ",
    "When identifying whether a product is fit for the market, it’s more effective to combine several customer needs into one offering instead of having multiple products that serve multiple needs.",
    "For example: Apple designed one IPhone to serve the need of communicating, organizing, engaging in multimedia both for personal use (photo albums) as well as entertainment (podcasts) and doing tasks such as calculations and notes. So instead of coming up with three different products i.e. a camera, a telephone, and  a computer, to  engage in all of the aforementioned activities, Apple just designed a single product.",
    "To best understand how a product fits the market, it’s important to identify “real” problems in our immediate environment to be able to observe, ask potential 'customers' questions to understand their needs and desires."
